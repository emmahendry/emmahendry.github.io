		<h2> Independent Learning</h2>

		<h3> Task 1:</h3>

		<p> When investigating possible topic choices, I knew initially I wanted to create a project with a connection to cyber communities. I personally find the topic of online communities to be very interesting and something I know I would enjoy exploring on a deeper level. This is a list of possible topic choices: </p>

		 <li>The Portrayal of Women Through Cyber Communities (Chosen)</li>
		 <li>The Covid-19 Pandemic’s Effect on New Media </li>
		 <li>Fake News And Its Ability To Spread Through Social Media</li>
		 <li>The Correlation Between Excessive Consumption Of Digital Media And Mental Health</li>

		 <h3> Task 2:</h3>


		 <h3> Questions I want To Answer Within This Project</h3>

		<p>Throughout my investigating in consideration with my topic I have decided these are the questions which I have set out to answer: </p>

		<li> What and where did these cyber communities come from? </li>
		<li> Reality of women’s life’s being affected by cyber communities </li>
		<li>How young people’s perception of women is changed due to these cyber groups </li>
		<li> The negative impacts these cyber groups can have on young people’s mental health</li>
		<li> Why are young boys relating to these cyber communities? </li>


		<h1> Lab Tasks</h1>

		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: Setting up your file structure</h2>
		<p>An investigation into cyberspace communities and their role played in the distribution of information across the web. I will discuss the negative impacts of unregulated fake news and the harmful consequences which it can have when it is practiced in person. This will be explored in conjunction with ways to remain protected online, navigate fake news and understand what makes information trustworthy.   </p>

		<p>Cyber communities can be a place of relatability for people across the world to connect over shared interests. This is a remarkable way for people to kindle friendships and feel to be part of something bigger than themselves. Overall, this nature of a cyber community is relatively harmless for example, fanbases for TV shows, movies or bands. However, it is apparent that unfavorable varieties of these communities can exist, this is what I am aiming to discuss along with the negative connotations these groups can have on people in society. Throughout this discussion I will focus closely on the adverse effects negative cyber communities are having on how younger generations perceptions of women in media.</p>
		<p> This is a list of sources which I have consulted:</p>
		<ul>
				<li> <a href="https://childhub.org/en/child-protection-news/safeguarding-be-vigilant-signs-incel-culture?language=uk"> Child Hub</a> </li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-council-for-internet-safety">Uk Gov</a> </li>

				<li> <a href="https://saferinternet.org.uk/guide-and-resource/supporting-vulnerable-groups-online">Safe Internet</a> </li>

		
	<p> An interesting academic source I found which aids in the continuation of my research is : <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-advances/article/incels-violence-and-mental-disorder-a-narrative-review-with-recommendations-for-best-practice-in-risk-assessment-and-clinical-intervention/6A934637D21AEE4C1D90FAF5FB63D769"> Incels, violence and mental disorder: a narrative review with recommendations for best practice in risk assessment and clinical intervention</a> In order to find this source I used Google Scholar, the key word which I used in order to find this source was “incel”. I started off by typing up the topic name for my website (The portrayal of women in new media) which led me to find more writings surrounding the topic of women’s body image in the media rather than the topic which I am wanting to focus on more closely which is more in relation to “incel” media. </p>
