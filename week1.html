		<h1>The Safety of younger generations in conjunction with cyber communities</h1>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p>An investigation into cyberspace communities and their role played in the distribution of information across the web. I will discuss the negative impacts of unregulated fake news and the harmful consequences which it can have when it is practiced in person. This will be explored in conjunction with ways to remain protected online, navigate fake news and understand what makes information trustworthy.   </p>

		<h2>Task 2</h2>
		<p>Cyber communities can be a place of relatability for people across the world to connect over shared interests. This is a remarkable way for people to kindle friendships and feel to be part of something bigger than themselves. Overall, this nature of cyber community is relatively harmless for example, (EXAMPLE GOES HERE). However, it is apparent that disadvantageous varieties of these communities can exist, this is what I am aiming to discuss along with the negative connotations these groups can have on people in society. Throughout this discussion I will focus closely on the adverse effects negative cyber communities are having on how younger generations perceptions of women in media.</p>
