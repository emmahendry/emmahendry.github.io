		<h1>The Safety of younger generations in conjunction with cyber communities</h1>
		<h2>MAD(A) Project Homepage</h2>

		<p>Society as of today is evidently centered round the use of the internet. Social media is a key part of people’s everyday lives whether its work related or for personal use. This is far more apparent in younger generations as they have not grown up in a world without it. So, with social media and online presences being such an integral part of day-to-day life for so many, safety on these platforms is fundamental. </p>

		<p> I aim to discuss the impact which unregulated internet usage can have on younger members of societies views on women in media. This will be done through looking at the role harmful cyber communities play in aiding in the formation of vulnerable people’s beliefs. </p>
