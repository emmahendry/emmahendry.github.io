		<h1>Week 8 Tasks</h1>
		
		<section id="task2">
		<h2>Task 1: Analyse the use of audio on the web</h2>
		
<p> Throughout my investigation into audio use on the web in conjunction with my chosen topic I discovered that most audio implemented into this genre of website tends to take the form of interviews. This varies from audio accompanied by video footage or only audio. What I have chosen to incorporate into my website is sound effects. This is to create a sort of ambient and immersive atmosphere for readers.  Instead of sticking with the typical style of audio implementation in these projects my indication is based on avoiding copyrighted media whilst still being able to provide a comprehensible piece of multimedia</p>

		<h2>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of audio content </h2>

		<p> To generate my portfolio of audio content I opted for the use of the <a href="https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/">BBC sound effects website</a> , I found this supplied me with the greatest form of audio representation that I was searching for to incorporate into my project. </p>
		


       <h1>Lab Tasks</h1>

       <h2>Task 1: Optimise your audio for Web use</h2>


       <p>After downloading and installing <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>. I selected my chosen audio files and imported them into the system. Once this step was completed, I contained to follow the tasks laid out in this weekâ€™s lab tasks to create the desired modified audio files. Finally, I exported the required files in the optimised formats and file sizes. This took the form of WAV and MP3 (creating 3 derivatives) and saving these to my master file.  </p>


<h2>Task 2: Exploring alternative options</h2>

       <p> Following on from the essential audio investigation, the following task requested a study in alternative editing of the audio sources. I found it best to crop my audio files down considerably as they were both around six minutes long, personally I believed this was too extensive to construct the atmosphere I was aiming to produce. </p>
