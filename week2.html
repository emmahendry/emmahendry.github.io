		<h2>Task 1: Identitfying Your Audience(s)</h2>
		<p>Personally, I believe the audience for my website is very broad and many different groups of people would benefit from the information presented. However, I would like to target this website more towards vulnerable members of society and those who care or are in contact with people that would fall into these groups (family members, friends, neighbors, careers).  People can be considered vulnerable to manipulation and negative cyber communities for many different causes but for this website I want to focus on age and gender. </p>

		<p>I do believe I have access to these groups due to my academic career along with having a wide spread range of ages throughout my personal and work life. </p>

		<p>Pre-existing expectations could be understandable from audiences as many believe that the internet is always truthful and believe everything which is part of it. Without prior knowledge on reliable and trustworthy sources of information it is apparent a lack of recognition to fake news is a possibility. </p>

		<h2>Task 2: Building An Audience Persona</h2>

		<p> Throughout my research on audiences, I have narrowed down what I believe the prevalence of my audience is going to be. As previously discussed, I imagine my audience is focused mainly towards younger individuals those who spend a larger portion of their time online compared to older generations. Due to this I have created to character studies: </p>

         <p> I wanted to create two audience personas which are at opposite sides of this discussion, this is the reason I chose to create these specific studies. </p>
