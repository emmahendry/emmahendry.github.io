		<h2>Task 1: Identitfying Your Audience(s)</h2>
		<p>Personally, I believe the audience for my website is very broad and many different groups of people would benefit from the information presented. However, I would like to target this website more towards vulnerable members of society and those who care or are in contact with people that would fall into these groups (family members, friends, neighbors, careers).  People can be considered vulnerable to manipulation and negative cyber communities for many different causes but for this website I want to focus on age and gender. </p>

		<p>I do believe I have access to these groups due to my academic career along with having a wide spread range of ages throughout my personal and work life. </p>

		<p>Pre-existing expectations could be understandable from audiences as many believe that the internet is always truthful and believe everything which is part of it. Without prior knowledge on reliable and trustworthy sources of information it is apparent a lack of recognition to fake news is a possibility. </p>

		<h2>Task 2: Building An Audience Persona</h2>

		<p> Throughout my research on audiences, I have narrowed down what I believe the prevalence of my audience is going to be. As previously discussed, I imagine my audience is focused mainly towards younger individuals those who spend a larger portion of their time online compared to older generations. Due to this I have created to character studies: </p>

         <p> I wanted to create two audience personas which are at opposite sides of this discussion, this is the reason I chose to create these specific studies. </p>

       <h1>Lab Tasks</h1>

       <h2>Task 1: Identify and evaluate websites</h2>


       <p>Both websites do address their topic, however, it is very clear that website A displays the information in a more visually pleasing manner. </p>

       <p>Website A is much more modern in comparison, it provides links to articles and events which the museum is hosting. The navigation of this website is much clearer than website B, the colour choice in the design is also very clear and clean. </p>

      <p>Website B provides a large range of information but fails to display it in an easy to digest manner for readers. The colour choice is also very harsh and would pose as a problem for readers. They do have multiple social media pages and other links to the companyâ€™s other platforms, they all do still work but it could be argued the website design is very outdated (old social media icons). </p>
</p>

<h2>Task 2: Consider your audience</h2>

<li> <a href="https://designmuseum.org/"> (A) Design Museum</a> </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.hrodc.com/">(B)hrodc</a> </li>

<p> Website A has some features which I examined to be suitable for my project. One being the drop-down navigation menu, I also liked the colour contrast of the yellow background with the black text. I felt this made the information stand out more to the reader.</p>

<p>However, Website B uses the same approach of colour contrast, but it is executed a lot poorer than website A. This is due to the bombardment of primary colours on the home page of the website. Personally, this is not an approach I want to take with my own project so I do not feel that this is something I would want to incorporate, at least not to this extent. 
</p>

<h2>Task 3: Begin a moodboard of design ideas</h2>

<p> I chose to use a drawing application to assist me in the design process for creating my mood board.</p>
