		<h1>The Portrayal of Women Through Cyber Communities  </h1>
		<h2>MAD(A) Project Homepage</h2>

		<p> In the current age of society, it is evidently clear that our lives are intertwined with the use of the internet and new media forms. Social media is a very telling example of this as it can permeate personal and work-related events. Although its use it far more prevalent throughout younger generations.  So, with social media and online presences being such an integral part of day-to-day life for so many, safety on these platforms is fundamental. </p>

		<p> I aim to discuss the impact which unregulated internet usage can have on younger members of societies views on women in media. This will be done through looking at the role cyber communities play in facilitating the development of vulnerable groups attitudes towards women, along with finding out the reasons why younger members of society are relating to these cyber communities.  </p>

<p> The definition of <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/incel">Incel</a>,which will be used throughout this project is <b>"a member of a group of people on the internet who are unable to find sexual partners despite wanting them, and who express hate towards people whom they blame for this".</b> </p>
