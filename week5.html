		<h2>Task 2: Evaluate Resources</h2>
		<p>The source which I have chosen to evaluate is <a href="https://childhub.org/en/child-protection-news/safeguarding-be-vigilant-signs-incel-culture?language=uk"> Childhub</a> . I chose this website due to its corelation with my topic, this website is weightily text reliant and is authored by various teachers from different walks of education across the United Kingdom. The text is accounting first hand experiences of teachers dealing with the effects of incel media on current generation pupils.  The website seems to be constructed with the use of passive voice rather than active, despite this the text seems to be written concisely and remains comprehensible for various reading levels. Another key element is the avoidance of stereotyping and biases, done so through the ability to change the default language to nine other dialects.  </p>

		<h2>Task 3: Reflective Statement (AWE writing process) </h2>

		<p> Throughout my research thus far I have determined my focal audience which is mainly younger members of society.  Primarily focusing on a male audience in conjunction with these online communities. I have found multiple academic sources which have provided me with multitudes of data, interviews, and articles. Up until this week’s tasks (week 5), I have created and uploaded a draft to my GitHub repository weeks 1-4. Throughout this process I have done a primary edit before the upload of my drafts, but this is part of the AWE practise which I need to emphasise on the further into this project’s finalisation.  </p>

		

       <h2>Lab Tasks</h2>

       <h1>Task 1: Using Voyant-tools to explore textual content</h1>


       <p>I have chosen the website which I evaluated in this week’s independent learning tasks to complete this task. </p>

       <p>The top 3 words used most in my inputted text were: 
<li> English (19)
<li> Children (16)
<li> Incel (14)
</p>

<h1>Task 2: Create Samples of text</h1>

<h2>Explanation of cyber communities and incel media</h2>

<a href="https://www.onewomanproject.org/gender/2022/9/20/the-serious-issue-with-incels"> The Serious Issue with Incels</a> 

<p> Cyber communities are societies that exist for the purpose of sharing interests, socialising, education, or work-based contexts virtually. Their existence allows for people to connect all over the globe at any point in time. Cyber communities are a great innovation for people to find like-minded individuals from shared interests in bands on social media platforms to coding communities.  The major takeaway is that cyber communities are a positive creation, allowing for the development of relationships between people who may or may not have ever interacted in real life. Despite this, there is the negative influences which cyber communities cultivate with bringing people together from around the world, through the ability to hide behind a screen. There is a tendency for insalubrious communities to form, such as “Incels”. An “Incel`’ is a word used to describe “a member of an online subculture of people who define themselves as incapable of attaining a romantic-sexual partner, even though they want one”. These communities tend to encourage misogynistic views towards women and obtain validation from other members for their detrimental opinions. A great example of someone who pushes this mindset is Andrew Tate. </p>

<h2>Andrew Tate</h2>

<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64125045 "> Who is Andrew Tate? The self-proclaimed misogynist influencer</a>

<p>Andrew Tate, the 36-year-old former world champion kickboxer turned “self-proclaimed misogynist” facing charges earlier this year when on trial for “rape, human trafficking and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women”. Tate found a new audience online through social media platforms and podcasts where he promoted his views on women which ultimately got him banned from YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. He has also explicitly stated his hatred for women in interviews along with proudly stating he is sexist and anyone who isn’t is lying to themselves. Ultimately a person who has gained such a large platform like Andrew Tate, across his social media accounts, it is apparent the ideology behind his followers is similar to his own. Obviously, this is not a constructive influence on the younger members of today’s society and furthermore lends itself to the expanding of the “incel” community.

<h2> Analysis:</h2>

<p> When reflecting on these paragraphs ability to be used for a multimedia website it is important that it follows the already constructed themes of said website, which these informative paragraphs accomplish. Key words found in my “Voyant” data can be found throughout both paragraphs for example, “incel”. It is also apparent that these paragraphs focus on my presented audience as they are mentioned within these texts. Overall, it can be considered that my narrative has been explored in a way which correlated closely with the theme of my project. </p>

<h1>Task 3: Updated Moodboard</h1>

<p> I chose to use the same drawing application to assist me in the design process for creating my mood board.</p>
