		<h1>Week 10 Tasks</h1>

		<h2>Task 1: Evaluate websites against accessibility standards</h2>

		<p>The website I have chosen to evaluate is a news article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/aug/16/social-networks-struggle-to-crack-down-on-incel-movement "> (Social networks struggle to crack down on ‘incel’ movement)</a>.which correlates with my subject matter.  </p>

		<p>  The first tool I have assessed is WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool), this is a web-based tool which is to support creators in the task of creating accessible content which doesn’t produce obstructions for users with disabilities. Below is the data I have uncovered in association with my website of choice: </p>

     width="400" 
     height="400"
alt="WAVE">
		
<p> WebAIM Contrast Checker is the second web tool which provide insight into the colour choices for website design. This is done so through using the colour hex or RGB codes. The contrast ratio for this website is 1.33:1, this is classified as a failure by the website’s metrics. </p>

     width="400" 
     height="400"
alt="WebAIM"> 
		<p>Another service this website provides is the ability to check links, backgrounds, and text for distinction within the colour choices. However, the website did pass in regard to these specific indicators:</p>

		 width="400" 
     height="400"
     alt="WebAIM (LINK CHECKER)">

<p> Finally, the Readability Test Tool issues a score on behalf of furthermost expended readability indicators. My website of choice was awarded a score of 50.6 (out of 100)  in relation to readability, this means the text is intermediate as the higher a score the easier it is to understand whilst a lower score insinuates a further complex text. </p>

<p> Find below the text statistics derived from my chosen website: </p>

		<h2> Task 2: Record your evaluation and reflect on your own practice</h2>
		
		<p> As seen above is my evaluation of my chosen website and how it has succeeded in aggregation with these accessibility tools. </p>

		<p> In the discussion of my own website, I have tried to integrate the notion of accessibility into my own design process as much as possible when making my decisions. So far, I have done this through using clear and uncomplicated fonts in order to keep my data comprehensible. Along with this the decision to keep my use language consistent and straightforward was a central focus of design process. Colour options have been my main endeavour throughout this project, I have trialled numerous different colour schemes so far in hopes of finding something that fits with my subject matter. Using colours which remain out with stereotypical choices in relation to gender (pink and blue) is something I have been dedicated to avoiding due to my subject matter relying heavily on this topic. Overall, I feel confident in. my abilities to deliver a website which is accessible for all users in relation to colour, font, imagery, language and construction. </p>


		

       <h1>Lab Tasks</h1>

       <h2>Task 1: Optimise your video for Web use </h2>


       <p>After correlating my portfolio of video content, I chose to edit my video in iMovie. Once familiarizing myself with the operating system of the application I started to add my media into the project in my desired arrangement. </p>

      <p> Once attaining my preferred timeline of clips, I then shortened down the length of some clips which I believed to be too extensive. To experiment further with the layout of my video I decided to add title text to the opening clip. When watching the draft, it seemed the colouring of the individual clips did not flow in a way which was aesthetically pleasing to view. To combat this, I edited the entire video with filters to create a cohesive theme. </p>

      <p> I decided to add background music throughout the video. This proved difficult when editing clips which already had audio. To combat this, I split the background music when it came to clips with audio and lowered the volume from 20% (on all other clips) to 7%. This was to remain cohesive but not take away from the information presented in the audio. </p>

      <p>When exporting the video following through with the tasks in step 6 I exported it in the 3 required video quality’s:</p>

       <ol>
  <li>High (1080p) </li>
  <li>Medium (720p) </li>
  <li>Low (480p) </li>
</ol>




<h2>Task 2: Exploring alternative options</h2>

<p> An alternative method of editing I chose to investigate was the use of filters. When conducting this research, I found a filter in the application OneShot which could pixelate the video footage. This would be a useful addition in moderation but can lose its impact when overused in projects. </p> 


<h2> Task 3: Presenting my findings </h2>

<h2> High (1080p): </h2>

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="1080p_WEEK9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<h2> Medium (720p): </h2>

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="720p_WEEK9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<h2> Low (480p): </h2>

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="480p_WEEK9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<h2> Alternative (1080p): </h2>

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="ALT_EDIT_WEEK9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
