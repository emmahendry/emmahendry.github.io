		<h1>Week 10 Tasks</h1>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h2>Task 1: Evaluate websites against accessibility standards</h2>

		<p>The website I have chosen to evaluate is a news article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/aug/16/social-networks-struggle-to-crack-down-on-incel-movement "> (Social networks struggle to crack down on ‘incel’ movement)</a>.which correlates with my subject matter.  </p>

		<p>  The first tool I have assessed is WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool), this is a web-based tool which is to support creators in the task of creating accessible content which doesn’t produce obstructions for users with disabilities. Below is the data I have uncovered in association with my website of choice: </p>

<p> WebAIM Contrast Checker is the second web tool which provide insight into the colour choices for website design. This is done so through using the colour hex or RGB codes. The contrast ratio for this website is 1.33:1, this is classified as a failure by the website’s metrics. </p>

		<p>Another service this website provides is the ability to check links, backgrounds, and text for distinction within the colour choices. However, the website did pass in regard to these specific indicators:</p>

<p> Finally, the Readability Test Tool issues a score on behalf of furthermost expended readability indicators. My website of choice was awarded a score of 50.6 (out of 100)  in relation to readability, this means the text is intermediate as the higher a score the easier it is to understand whilst a lower score insinuates a further complex text. </p>

		<h2> Task 2: Record your evaluation and reflect on your own practice</h2>
		
		<p> As seen above is my evaluation of my chosen website and how it has succeeded in aggregation with these accessibility tools. </p>

		<p> In the discussion of my own website, I have tried to integrate the notion of accessibility into my own design process as much as possible when making my decisions. So far, I have done this through using clear and uncomplicated fonts in order to keep my data comprehensible. Along with this the decision to keep my use language consistent and straightforward was a central focus of design process. Colour options have been my main endeavour throughout this project, I have trialled numerous different colour schemes so far in hopes of finding something that fits with my subject matter. Using colours which remain out with stereotypical choices in relation to gender (pink and blue) is something I have been dedicated to avoiding due to my subject matter relying heavily on this topic. Overall, I feel confident in. my abilities to deliver a website which is accessible for all users in relation to colour, font, imagery, language and construction. </p>


		<h1> Lab Tasks </h1>

		<h2> Task 3: What about other forms of accessibility? </h2>

      <p> The first way in which I would consider the topic of accessibility is through colour choice, by ensuring the colour pallet of a website-based project is understandable for users is significant. This can be accomplished through the understanding of the tools we used in week 10. Such as WebAIM, the contrast checker this website runs is a advantageous technique to get insight on how a websites design effects users ability to process the information. <p>

	<p> Secondly, using fonts and language which remain legible for the majority of users can be beneficial for readability. This ties in with Readability Test tool we looked at this week. This allows developers to discover an average suitability based on the factor of age. Ensuring that a website remains educational and articulate, whilst maintaining a comprehensible reading style is remarkably important to a successful website design. </p>

	<p> Font choice ties in with this aspect, as intricate or eccentric font choices can cause accessibility complications for users. When creating large portions of text for readers its key to ensure this is done in a manner which remains legible as fonts which take the practice of cursive writing can prove difficult to understand. </p>
