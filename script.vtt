Andrew Tate’s vile misogyny infiltrates our classrooms and society.

Teachers are now having to develop their

00:00:23:00 - -> 00:00:24:00 align:middle:90%
 own resources to re-educate boys who 

7
00:00:25:00 - -> 00:00:26:00 align:middle:90%
 are being brainwashed online by his 

8
00:00:27:00 - -> 00:00:27:00 align:middle:90%
 deeply toxic messaging.

The prime minister has been too slow to 

10
00:00:29:00 - -> 00:00:30:00 align:middle:90%
recognise the damage this is causing.

11
00:00:30:01 - -> 00:00:31:00 align:middle:90%
 What has he done?

What is the government doing to tackle

13
00:00:32.01:00 - -> 00:00:35:00 align:middle:90%
 this misogyny, this incel culture and

14
00:00:36:00 - -> 00:00:37:00 align:middle:90%
  the radicalisation of young men in 

15
00:00:37:01 - -> 00:00:37:05 align:middle:90%
  this country? 

16
00:00:37:05 - -> 00:00:39:00 align:middle:90%
And will he commit to giving teachers

17
00:00:39:01 - -> 00:00:41:00 align:middle:90%
 the resources they need to address

18
00:00:42:00 - -> 00:00:43:00 align:middle:90%
  this problem head on.

Mr speaker, when we got onto funding,

20
00:00:46:01 - -> 00:00:48:00 align:middle:90%
 we announced in the autumn statement two

21
00:00:48:10 - -> 00:00:49:00 align:middle:90%
  billion pounds of extra funding for

22
00:00:49:01 - -> 00:00:50:00 align:middle:90%
   our schools.

23
00:00:50:01 - -> 00:00:52:00 align:middle:90%
But I’m also proud this government has

24
00:00:52:01 - -> 00:00:53:00 align:middle:90%
 introduced the world leading, world

25
00:00:53:01 - -> 00:00:56:00 align:middle:90%
  first online safety bill. 

26
00:00:56:01 - -> 00:00:57:00 align:middle:90%
Which specifically improves

27
00:00:57:01 - -> 00:01:00:00 align:middle:90%
 protections for children and puts

28
00:01:00:01 - -> 00:01:01:00 align:middle:90%
  very strict obligations and 

29
00:01:01:01 - -> 00:01:03:00 align:middle:90%
  penalties on tech companies for 

30
00:01:03:01 - -> 00:01:04:00 align:middle:90%
  enforcing them. 

31
00:01:04:01 - -> 00:01:07:00 align:middle:90%
