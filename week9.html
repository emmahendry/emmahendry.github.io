		<h1>Week 9 Tasks</h1>
		
		<section id="task2">
		<h2>Task 1: Analyse the use of video on the web</h2>
		<p>Throughout my search for video supporting comparable multimedia websites with similar themes to my research I discovered video assistance was usually presented to add academic value to the authors’ argument.  Most frequently in the form of YouTube videos or interviews posted by news outlets such as the BBC. </p>

		<p> Video length ranges depending on the supporting media, Interviews tend to be no longer than 10 minutes <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64125045">(BBC)</a>. One website which I have previously investigated for their image usage is London School of Ecomonics and Political Science,this website also provides readers with a YouTube video to enhance to their argument. </p>

		<p>Within my research the use of video has positively amplified the comprehension of the media presented throughout my chosen websites. I believe this is due to readers benefiting from diverse forms of presenting information, by breaking up large quantities of text with interactive media it keeps readers engaged with the content for longer. </p>

		<h2> Task 2: Generate a portfolio of video content</h2>
		
		<p> To generate my portfolio of video content i used website susch as <a href="https://www.pexels.com/ "> plexels.com</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ "> Youtube</a>.

		

       <h1>Lab Tasks</h1>

       <h2>Task 1: Optimise your video for Web use </h2>


       <p>After correlating my portfolio of video content, I chose to edit my video in iMovie. Once familiarizing myself with the operating system of the application I started to add my media into the project in my desired arrangement. </p>

      <p> Once attaining my preferred timeline of clips, I then shortened down the length of some clips which I believed to be too extensive. To experiment further with the layout of my video I decided to add title text to the opening clip. When watching the draft, it seemed the colouring of the individual clips did not flow in a way which was aesthetically pleasing to view. To combat this, I edited the entire video with filters to create a cohesive theme. </p>

      <p> I decided to add background music throughout the video. This proved difficult when editing clips which already had audio. To combat this, I split the background music when it came to clips with audio and lowered the volume from 20% (on all other clips) to 7%. This was to remain cohesive but not take away from the information presented in the audio. </p>

      <p>When exporting the video following through with the tasks in step 6 I exported it in the 3 required video quality’s:</p>

       <ol>
  <li>High (1080p) </li>
  <li>Medium (720p) </li>
  <li>Low (480p) </li>
</ol>

<p> There is a clear difference in performance throughout these different video quality's. </p>


<h1> Presenting my findings </h1>


<h2> High (1080p): </h2>

<video width="600" height="400" controls>
  <source src="video/1080p_week9.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  	<track
    label="English"
    kind="subtitles"
    srclang="en"
    src="audio/vtt/script.vtt"
    default />
  <track
</video>

<h2> Medium (720p): </h2>

<video width="600" height="400" controls>
  <source src="video/720p_week9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<h2> Low (480p): </h2>

<video width="600" height="400" controls>
  <source src="video/420p_week9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>


<h2>Task 2: Exploring alternative options</h2>

<p> An alternative method of editing I chose to investigate was the use of filters. When conducting this research, I found a filter in the application iMovie which could make the video footage black and white. This would be a useful addition to projects trying to create a certain aesthetic apparent to their viewers. </p> 

<h2> Alternative (1080p): </h2>

<video width="600" height="400" controls>
