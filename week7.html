		<h2>Task 1: The stages of the creative process</h2>
		<H3>Preparation:</H3>

<p>When beginning my creative process, I turned to Pinterest for colour pallets and sample web design layouts. I found this very beneficial in my deliberation amongst the concepts I was starting to form. Some of my main goals consist of remaining gender neutral in my approach with colour, I’m dealing particularly with the subject of gender throughout my project, and I want to remain balanced in my use of stereotypical gender related colouring. Following on from this I want to have a coherent aesthetic throughout my project which flows easily and remains accessible.</p> 

<h3>Incubation:</h3>

<p> In conjunction with my colour pallet, I have trialled multiple variations, ranging from yellows, greys, and varying shade of blue. Having trialled these pallets I have come to the conclusion that darker green tones with one or two statement colours is the best route for staying gender neutral in my approach.  Alongside this, the notion for any imagery to match my colour pallet is principally essential.</p>

<h3>Ideation:</h3>

<p>My creative process is starting to become distinct as I believe I have anchored down my colour pallet and have an overall idea for the final layout of my website. I am currently working on a collection of imagery to implement into my pages.</p>

<h3>Evaluation:</h3>

<p>After thinking through multiple different paths my project could take topic wise and aesthetically. My current and final creative decisions should be very similar in their final form.</p>

<h3>Implementation:</h3>

<p>Throughout this process I am continuously implementing my concepts into my project development.

		<h2>Task 2: Analyse the use of images on the web </h2>

		<p> An overall theme I have encountered when looking specifically at incel related articles is the use of electronic imagery and male silhouettes. I believe this is to allude to the ability to hide personal identities on these platforms along with showing how anyone you interact with on a day-to-day basis could be a part of them. Although most sites I am looking into are published in the last few years its apparent that the sites are designed for an older audience. What I am to achieve is tailoring my imagery choices to maintain the formality of an educational website with also incorporating a younger approach to the design to encourage younger users’ attention.  I do believe that most imagery is used for aesthetic purposes, but it does correlate well with the websites key messaging.   </p>
 <p> See below examples I have investigated which helped me reach this conclusion:</p>

       <h2>Lab Tasks</h2>

       <h1>Task 1: Editing digital images</h1>

       <p>When editing my chosen images for this project It proved to be important to maintain a high quality of image, along with the colours matching the theme of my website design. After following the steps laid out in this week’s lab tasks the image, I was left with ultimately proved to be of a quality which I found fit within these criteria. There was definitely a drop in resolution but that was expected as my original image was twice the size of the edited jpg. This allowed for the image to not compromise the running of my website with still maintaining an acceptable level of resolution as not to compromise the aesthetics of my project. Overall, my scoring on the subjective fidelity criteria scale would be 1, I believe this image conversion still proves to be of an extremely high quality. </p>

       <p> When creating alternative edits of my chosen image I modified the sizing and optimization of the image. Instead of opting for the suggested 800 x 521 and grey scaling of the image, I chose to up the sizing to 1000 x 665. Along with this I chose to convert the image to the web optimised pallet rather than grey scaling. I felt the benefit of scaling up to increase the resolution was lost with the combination of the web optimised pallet. Personally, I would rate this image conversion at a 3 on the subject fidelity criteria scale, due to the loss in quality but the ability to still understand what the image is trying to convey.. After this research I have come to the conclusion that keeping my images within the same colour pallet or theme will create the greatest outcome for my overall website flow and presentation. </p>
